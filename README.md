LeBonCoinSearcher
=================

I made this because Leboncoin doesn't provide any API to navigate through their items.
Written in JAVA.

A simple searcher for "Le bon coin" website.
It's a small Open Source project in a bigger which will try to allo a better buyer search.


The Main.java show you a simple request.
Categories are the same show in the website, simply replace spaces by '-' and remove accents.
I'll improve the searcher to allow phone-number recuperation, mail.. etc..
